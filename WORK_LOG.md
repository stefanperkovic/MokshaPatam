| Sep 3 |  8-8:30pm  |                                                           I thought about how I would go through the board in order to get the most efficient solution. I remember last year that we had different type of search algorithms to do this. I went backed and looked at at DFS and BFS from last year to try and re-understand the concepts and algorithms. I started to think about how I would begin the code. |
| Sep 4 | 10 - 10:30 | I worked on trying to get a rough idea of the functions necessary for BFS.  I want to first check for each num if I it hits a ladder or snake and then change the num to that location and keep track of the previous node.If not on a snake or ladder than I want to move to each next number over and also keep track of the previus node. In the end ill check the length of path and see if its shortest. |
