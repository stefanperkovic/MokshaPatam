| Sep 3 |    8-8:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                           I thought about how I would go through the board in order to get the most efficient solution. I remember last year that we had different type of search algorithms to do this. I went backed and looked at at DFS and BFS from last year to try and re-understand the concepts and algorithms. I started to think about how I would begin the code. |
| Sep 4 | 10 - 10:30 am  |                                                                                                                 I worked on trying to get a rough idea of the functions necessary for BFS.  I want to first check for each num if I it hits a ladder or snake and then change the num to that location and keep track of the previous node.If not on a snake or ladder than I want to move to each next number over and also keep track of the previus node. In the end ill check the length of path and see if its shortest. |
| Sep 5 |  9:30 - 10pm   | I realized that I should run my main while loop in terms of the queue instead of in terms of if we hit the end. We will check if we are at the end in our while loop so that we know we have found the quickest way possible as we are using BFS. Also I realized that I should not be adding all adjacent nodes to the queue, but rather only the ones that haven't been previosuly visited. I also realized that I should check for snakes in ladders not at the begining, but rather when I am adding a node to the queue. |

This is more efficient and a more practical way to store the information. Also started to work on a rolls array to keep track of them. |
